# rspec-autotest [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/rspec/rspec-autotest.svg?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/rspec/rspec-autotest) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/rspec/rspec-autotest.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/rspec/rspec-autotest) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/rspec/rspec-autotest/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/r/rspec/rspec-autotest?branch=master)

`rspec-autotest` provides integration between autotest and RSpec; Autotest is not included
in this gem and can be installed via the `autotest-standalone` or `zentest` gems.

## Usage

RSpec Autotest ships with a specialized subclass of Autotest. To use it, just add a
`.rspec` file to your project's root directory, and run the `autotest` command
as normal:

    $ autotest

## Bundler

The `autotest` command generates a shell command that runs your specs. If you
are using Bundler, and you want the shell command to include `bundle exec`,
require the Autotest bundler plugin in a `.autotest` file in the project's root
directory or your home directory:

    # in .autotest
    require "autotest/bundler"

## Rails

To use RSpec and Rails with autotest, bring in the `autotest-rails` gem:

```ruby
# Gemfile
gem 'autotest-rails', :group => [:development, :test]
```

`autotest` will now autodetect RSpec and Rails after you run the `rails
generate rspec:install` command.

## Gotchas

### Autotest style autotest/rspec_rspec2 doesn't seem to exist. Aborting.

This happens if you're using rspec-3.x + rspec-autotest-1.x and you
still have rspec-core-2.x installed. You have two options to resolve this issue:

1. Uninstall rspec-core-2.x (or remove it from the current gemset if you use a
tool that supports gemsets).
1. Pass a `--style` flag to the `autotest` executable, which should resolve the
version of rspec correctly to 3.x:

```shell
autotest --style rspec
```

### Invalid Option: --tty

The `--tty` option was [added in rspec-core-2.2.1](changelog), and is used
internally by RSpec. If you see an error citing it as an invalid option, you'll
probably see there are two or more versions of rspec-core in the backtrace: one
< 2.2.1 and one >= 2.2.1.

This usually happens because you have a newer rspec-core installed, and an
older rspec-core specified in a Bundler Gemfile. If this is the case, you can:

1. specify the newer version in the Gemfile (recommended)
2. prefix the `autotest` command with `bundle exec`


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'rspec-autotest'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install rspec-autotest
